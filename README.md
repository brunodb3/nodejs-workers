# nodejs-workers
by [@brunodb3](https://github.com/brunodb3)

This is a simple project I used to learn about NodeJS threads and clusters.

## Installing/First steps

Before cloning, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (i use version 8.9.4) installed and configured.

Install the dependencies and run `npm start` to open the application using [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to watch for code changes.

```sh
npm install # installs modules from package.json file, via npm
npm start # runs the app with live monitoring using nodemon (see package.json)
```

## Git versioning

For git versioning standards, this project uses
[Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), making it easy
to `commit`, `push` and update the `CHANGELOG.md` for every developer.
